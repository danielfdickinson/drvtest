For kicks an ancient 8086/8088 assembler program
for testing drives that I wrote using either
Turbo Assembler or NASM, or something even more
limited in terms of aid for writing code.
for operation from a floppy drive.  Didn't have
a rescue Linux distro at the time (dialup and
working on ancient computers).

It was written to avoid reliance on proprietary
tools that I couldn't afford.
